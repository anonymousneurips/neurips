This library corresponds to the " Neural Linear Bandits: Overcoming Catastrophic Forgetting through Likelihood Matching". 
Deep Bayesian Bandits Showdown: An Empirical Comparison of Bayesian 
Deep Networks for Thompson Sampling paper, published in ICLR 2018. We provide a benchmark to test 
decision-making algorithms for contextual-bandits. In particular, the current library implements a 
variety of algorithms (many of them based on approximate Bayesian Neural Networks and Thompson sampling), 
and a number of real and syntethic data problems exhibiting a diverse set of properties.
